\title{Create a tiling scheme from a raster}
\usage{
grout(x, blocksize = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a raster specification, a list with extent, dimension, projection}

\item{blockX}{tile dimensions in columns (X)}

\item{blockY}{tile diemnsions in rows (Y)}
}
\value{
A "tile scheme" object with information about the tile spacing and extent.
}
\description{
The input may be an actual raster or a matrix. There is an assumed
block size of 256x256, and the scheme will record the number of tiles
in each dimension and the amount of "overlapping dangle" when the dimensions
of the data don't fit neatly within the tiles.
}
\details{
The tile scheme object has print and plot methods for basic information. 

See function [as_polys()] to generate tiles from the scheme.
}
\examples{
## one (too) big tile
tile <- grout(volcano, c(256L, 256L))
plot(tile)
tile

raster::image(rv, add = TRUE)
axis(1); axis(2)

## more size appropriate
tils <- grout(volcano, c(8, 8))
plot(tils)
raster::image(rv, add = TRUE)
plot(tils, add = TRUE)
}
