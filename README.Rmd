# tropo

Abstract tiling schemes. 


Given a grid, impose a tiling scheme. The dangle is how much overlap the tiles imply. 

```{r grid}

r <- raster::raster(matrix(1:12, 30, 44), xmn= 0,xmx = 4, ymn = 0, ymx = 3)

library(tropo)
(t1 <- tiles(r, blockX = 12, blockY = 12))
plot(t1)

(t2 <- tiles(volcano, 12, 16))

plot(t2)
```

We can generate polygons from these. 

```{r poly}
p <- as_polys(t1)

sp::plot(p)
```

Or just plot the scheme. 

```{r plot}
plot(t1)
```
